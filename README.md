# Food Ordering System

## General Information
The main objective of the application is to understand the basics of PHP, JavaScript and MySQL. 
Moreover, I value recent learning about the PHP Programming language as well as seeing how powerful and dynamic they are when it comes to web designing and applications.

## Proposed Methodology
This online website enables the end users to register online, select the food from the e-menu card, read the E-menu card and order food online. By just selecting the food that the user want to have. By using this application the work of the Waiter is reduced and we can also say that the work is nullified.  The benefit of this is that if there is rush in the Restaurant then there will be chances that the waiters will be unavailable and the users can directly order the food online by using this application.

## Benefits
- This will minimize the number of employees at the back of the counter.
- The system will help to reduce labor cost involved.
- The system will be less probable to make mistake, since itâ€™s a machine.
- Sometimes, the waiting time is so huge that customers will actually lose interest in the item. Moreover, some customers may be busy to come physically to the restaurant and eat.
This will avoid long queues at the counter due to the speed of execution and number of optimum screens to accommodate the maximum throughput.
- No more busy phones or the requirement for extra phone lines.
- An edge over the competition at an affordable price.

## Users OfThe System
The users of the system include the user and admin. The customers will visit the website, check for the items available in the menu, order for one or more items in the menu. All the activities will be recorded in the database for all the events.
###### Admin
Using a graphical interface, it will allow an Admin to manage the menu that is displayed to users of the web ordering system:
*	See the no. of users, restaurants, cities and orders
*	Add/ delete restaurants.
